# Seed-Test
Behaviour-driven development (BDD) extends the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach by the ‘desired behaviour’ of a software. It is designed to ensure a collaboration between business analysts and developers with explicitly written down scenarios.

## What is Seed-Test?
Seed-Test is a website user interface testing tool, which uses approaches of behaviour-driven development and the notation of Gherkin to enable developers and business users to execute automated tests for their website. It can be tested on the official [website](https://seed-test-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

We are greateful for any testing and feedback, so please help us by filling out this [feedback form](https://seed-test-frontend.herokuapp.com/feedback)

## Installation
It is necessary to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Seed-Test uses Google Chrome ba default for executing selenium. Download the version of [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) that matches your version of Google Chrome. Extract the "chromedriver.exe" and set a path to it.

To install and use the application localy, clone or download the repository as a zip.

Open up two consoles and navigate with one of the consoles to the backend and with the other to the frontend folder via this commands:
```
cd backend
cd frontend
```

Then install all necessary node modules once in the backend and in the frontend folder:
```
npm install
```

Create an `.env` file in the backend folder with following variables:
```
REPORT_DELETION_TIME=5
TESTACCOUNT_NAME=
TESTACCOUNT_REPO=
TESTACCOUNT_TOKEN=
PORT=8080 
SESSION_SECRET=
JIRA_SECRET=
DATABASE_URI=
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4200 
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
PASSPORT_GITHUB_LOCAL_PW_FIELD = id
```
First you need a DATABASE_URI provided by your MongoDB (local or cloud).
For the GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET and GITHUB_CLIENT_ID check out [GitHub´s Guide on Autorizing OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).
The JIRA_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET are values used for the encryption of sensible data. Choose a strong Secret like for example generated by [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/).


Create an `.env` file in the frontend folder with following variables:
```
API_SERVER=http://localhost:8080/api
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
```

To run the frontend server switch to the frontend folder and use this command:
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
To run the backend server switch to the backend folder and use this command:
```
cd backend
npm start
```

Once everything is running, you can access the website by typing this into a browser window:
```
http://localhost:4200/login
```



## Database
Seed-Test uses a MongoDB. You can either create your own locally or in the cloud.
For installation details check out our Check out the [Database Tutorial](https://github.com/adessoAG/Seed-Test/wiki/Database)

Once you set up the database, insert the uri into the .env file in the backend folder.
Save it!

Then you can set up the database through this command:
```
npm run database
```
This command creates the collections 'Stories' and 'stepTypes' and inserts the current stepTypes into the collection.
The Stories collection can stay empty. It will be automatically filled while accessing the web-app.
